<h2>Fort Hill</h2>
<p>The first section of the project show 3D images of Fort Hill, Ohio. The first image shows the Digital Surface Model (DSM) while the second shows the Digital Terrain Model (DTM).</p>

<p>Next, a hillshade layer was created to help better visualize the terrain. For reference, an outline of the Fort Hill Earthworks was included.</p>

<p>The two figures below use a graphical approach to display the height of Fort Hill.</p>

<p>Next, to help visualize the Fort Hill canopy height, a hillshade image and a raster histogram were created.

<p>Lastly, this image shows the tallest Fort Hill Earthworks trees as well as gaps in the canopy cover.
