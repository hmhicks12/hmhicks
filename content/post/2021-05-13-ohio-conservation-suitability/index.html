<p>This project will determine while 100m by 100m plots of land within Licking County are suitable for conservation. To determine suitability, these variables will be used:
- Within a 100m radius of existing woodlands
- Within a 100m radius of existing stream or wetland
- Further than 100m from roadway
- Further than 100m from railway</p>
