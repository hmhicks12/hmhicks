<p>With growing populations in Fort Collins and Loveland, CO, transit expansion will soon be required. For this project, I proposed a new 50km rail line that will connect the two cities. I have proposed two different systems, each of which have their transit stops located near important regional centers.</p>

<div id="transit-line-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Transit Line #1</h2>
<p><img src="City%20Centers%201.jpg" />
This map shows a selection of important regional centers where future transit stops will be located.</p>

To help visualize accessibility, this map highlights the buildings and parcels that will be within 1km (10 minutes walk) of each transit stop.</p>

Finally, this map shows the route of the proposed Transit Line #1.</p>

<div id="transit-line-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Transit Line #2</h2>
<p><img src="City%20Centers%202.jpg" />
This second proposal selects a new set of important regional centers. This route is slightly longer than Transit Line #1, but it contains an extra stop along its route to provide transit access to more people.</p>

Similar to the first proposal, this second map highlights the buildings and parcels within 1km of each proposed transit stop.</p>

Lastly, this map shows the route of Transit Line #2</p>
