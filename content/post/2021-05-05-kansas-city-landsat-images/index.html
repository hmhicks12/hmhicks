<p>This project includes four images providing different ways to interpret the heat island effect in Kansas City.</p>
<p><img src="True%20Color%20Layout%20copy.jpg" />
This first image shows a base LANDSAT image of Kansas City that allows us to get familiar with the space.</p>
<p><img src="Heat%20Island%20Layout%20copy.jpg" />
Secondly, this image show the heat island effect in two different ways. The darker reds in each image signify higher temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="Green%20Infrastructure%20copy.jpg" />
This image helps to show vegetation density within Kansas City. The two view allow us to see green space from two different viewpoints.</p>
<p><img src="Rendered%20Layer%20copy.jpg" />
Lastly, this rendered map shows a combination of vegetation areas and the heat island effect. This map blends two of the previous images to give a new rendered LANDSAT image.</p>
